# Data Visualization

A comprehensive repository containing notes, examples, and resources for popular Python data visualization libraries.

## 📊 Overview

This repository serves as a learning resource and reference guide for data visualization in Python. It covers three major visualization libraries:
- **Matplotlib** - The foundational plotting library for Python
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization built on top of Matplotlib
- **Plotly** - Interactive, publication-quality graphs

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Provide structured notes and examples for each visualization library
- Demonstrate best practices for creating effective visualizations
- Serve as a quick reference for common plotting tasks
- Help learners transition between different visualization libraries
- Showcase the strengths and use cases of each library

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
